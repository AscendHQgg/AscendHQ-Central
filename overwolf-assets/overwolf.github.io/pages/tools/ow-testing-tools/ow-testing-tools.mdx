Overwolf Apps often react to situations as soon as they happen, using a context built up
over what are possibly entire sessions of gameplay, which often makes testing them a unique challenge.
As such, we have developed an ever-growing set of tools, meant to help bridge the gap between thorough,
consistent unit-testing, and the sequential, real-time nature of Overwolf Apps.

This set currently includes the following tools:
- [Overwolf Events Recorder](ow-testing-tools/ow-events-recorder)
- [Overwolf Events Tester](ow-testing-tools/ow-events-tester)
